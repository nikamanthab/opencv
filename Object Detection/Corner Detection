harris corner detection:
    convert the image into grayscale
    convert into float 32
        f32gray = np.float32(image)
    harris_corners = cv2.cornerHarris(f32gray, 3, 3, 0.05)

    //have to complete


good features to track: --- better way
    corners = cv2.goodFeaturesToTrack(image,100000,0.01,15)
    syntax:
        corners = cv2.goodFeaturesToTrack(image,maxcorners,qualitylevel,mindistance)
        quality level - minimum accepted quality of the image
        maxcorners - max no of corners that can be identified
        
        maxcorners*qualitylevel - the corners with lesser than the product as its quality are rejected.
        minDistance - min dist bet two corners
        
       
    
    for corner in corners:
        x,y = corner[0]
        x = int(x)
        y = int(y)
        
        x,y -- are the coordinates of the corner
