SIFT:
    it stands for scale invariant feature transform

    find the interesting points using gaussian method
    create vector descriptive of the interesting areas

    interesting points are scanned at several diff scales
        rat invariance is achieved by obtaining the orientation assignment using gradient magnitude
        
SURF:
    speeded up robust features
    it is fater than SIFT
    it uses hessian matrix approach
    
FAST - key point detection only
BRIEF - descriptors quickly
ORB - combination of both FAST and BRIEF

create detector -> input image into the detector -> obtain key points -> draw key points
