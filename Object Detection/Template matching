It is used to find a piece of a image is present in the particular larger image

result = cv2.matchTemplate(gray,template,cv2.TM_CCOEFF)
min_val, max_val, min_loc, max_loc = cv2.minMaxLoc(result)

correlation coefficient - TM_CCOEFF
there are many others too


To represent the image:
    topleft = max_loc
    bottomright = (topleft[0]+50,topleft[1]+50)
    cv2.rectangle(image,topleft,bottomright,(225,25,0),5)
