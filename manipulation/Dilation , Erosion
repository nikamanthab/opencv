dilation - adds pixals to the boundaries of object in an image
erosion - removes pixels at the boundaries of objects inan image
opening - erosion followed by dilation
closing -  dilation followed by erosion

kernal = np.ones((5,5),np.uint8)
erosion = cv2.erode(image,kernal,iteration=1)
             /.dilate
opening = cv2.mrphologyEx(image,cv2.MORPH_OPEN,kernal)
closing = cv2.morphologyEx(image,cv2.MORPH_CLOSE,kernal)
