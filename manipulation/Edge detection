edge:
    sudden changes or discontinuties in an image
    
    3 diff models:
        1.Sobel - to emphasize vertical or horizontal edges
        2.Laplacian - gets all orientations
        3.Canny - Optimal due to low error rate, well defined edges and accurate detection
        
        in canny:
        canny = cv2.Canny(image,threshold1,threshold2)
        
        1.any gradient value greater than threshold2 is considered to be an edge.
        2.any value below threshold1 is considered not to be an edge.
        3.values in between threshold1 and threshold2 are either classified  as edges or non edges based on how their intensities are connected
