they are distortions in an image
types:

    a.affine - preseve parallelism
        
        1.scaling:
        
            cv2.resize(image, dsize(output image size), xscale, yscale , interpolation)
        
        2.rotation:
        
            cv2.getRotationMatrix2D(rot_center_x,rot_center_y,angle of rot,scale) // could get canvas bound problems
            so can use:
                cv2.transpose(img) //this can be used instead
        
        3.translation:
           
           shift the start point of the img by tx and ty distance
            T = |1 0 Tx|
                |0 1 Ty|
            T = np.float32([[1,0,Tx],[0,1,Ty]])
            Translatedimg = cv2.wrapAffine(image , T , (width,height))
            
            
    b.non-affine - dont preseve parallelism
        also known as projective/homgraphy transforms
        
wrapAffine -- method used in all transformations 

interpolation:
    this is a methos of constructing new data points within the range of a discrete set of known data points 
    types:
        cv2.INTER_AREA
                NEAREST
                LINEAR
                CUBIC
