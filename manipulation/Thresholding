converting a "grayscale" image into binary image
segmenting 0-255 into two and assigned binary values 0,1 for each range

Syntax:
    ret,thresh = cv2.threshold(image,Threshold value,max value,type)
    
Types:
    cv2.THRESH_BINARY
    cv2.THRESH_BINARY_INV
    cv2.THRESH_TRUNC
    cv2.THRESH_TOZERO
    cv2.THRESH_TOZERO_INV
    
    Adaptive thresholding:
        Adaptive mean thresholding
        Otsu's thresholding
        Gaussian Otsu's thresholding
    
blurring of image can reduce the noise:///////important
    
    image = cv2.GaussianBlur(image,(3,3),0)
    
blur = cv2.GaussianBlur(image,(3,3),0)
_,thresh = cv2.threshold(blur,0,255,cv2.THRESH_BINARY + cv2.THRESH_OTSU)
cv2.imshow("guassian otsu",thresh)


This technique can be used to remove watermarks from the image
