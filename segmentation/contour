Partition images into different regions

CONTOURS are continuous lines or curves that bound or cover the full boundary of an image

important for:
    object detection
    shape analysis
    
contour generation:
grayscale the img -- necessary because the contour func takes in grayscale image
find canny edges -- not necessary but to reduce noise

ret,thresh = cv2.threshold(gray,127,255,0) - threshold the image before applying contouring

Syntax:
    contouredimg = edges.copy()
    im2, contours, heirarchy = cv2.findContours(contouredimg, cv2.RETR_EXTERNAL, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_NONE)
    Syntax:
        im2, contours, heirarchy = cv2.findContours(contouredimg, retrival mode, approximation mode)
        
        approximation mode:
        CHAIN_APPROX_NONE - has all the main points in the contour
        CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE - has all the end vertices
        
        retrival modes:
        cv2.RETR_LIST - all contours
        *cv2.RETR_EXTERNAL - outer contours only
        cv2.RETR_COMP - all in a 2-level hierarchy
        *cv2.RETR_TREE - all in full hierarchy
    
Drawing contours:
    cv2.drawContours(image,contours,-1,(211,0,148),3)
    Syntax:
        cv2.drawContours(image, contours, countours index, colour of contour, line thickness)
