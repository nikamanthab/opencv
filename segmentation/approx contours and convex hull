Approximate polygens:
    approx = cv2.approxPolyDP(contour,Appromimation accuracy,closed)
        approx accuracy - determines the accuracy of the approximation 
                          small value gives precise approximation
                          large value gives more genric approx
                          the value should be lesser than 5%
        closed - takes boolean input
        
        
To remove the contour that covers the whole image in case of white background can be removed by:
    sorting the contours by area and removing the largest contour from the list
    
    n = len(contours) - 1
    contours = sorted(contours, key = cv2.contourArea, reverse = False)[:n]
    
convex hull:
    generates a polygen around the contour that has minimum sides and best fits

    hull = cv2.convexHull(contour)
    cv2.drawContour(image,[hull], 0 ,(255,25,0),2)
